### Edges based on Direction
- **Undirected Edge:** No specific direction; connects two vertices bidirectionally.
- **Directed Edge (Arc):** Has a direction, pointing from one vertex to another.

### Path in Graphs

**Simple Path:** A path is in which no vertices and no edges are repeated. Example is the above diagram of the graph with path ABFH.

The only difference between a path and simple path is that in simple path edges and vertices don't repeat but in a path edges and vertices can repeat.
