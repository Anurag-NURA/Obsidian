Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or collection in increasing or decreasing order of some property.

If a list is __Unsorted List__ than we perform [[Linear Search]] but if it is a __Sorted List__ we can then perform a [[Binary Search]].

### Classification of Sorting Algorithm:
1. On the basis of `Time Complexity`
2. On the basis of `Space Complexity` or `Memory Usage`
	- In-place, Constant memory 
	- Memory usage grows with input size
3. `Stability`, preserves the relative order of elements
4. `Internal` Sort (records are on main memory) V/s `External` Sort (records are on disk/tapes) 
5. `Recursive` or Non-Recursive
