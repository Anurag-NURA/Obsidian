Next time you go for a JavaScript interview, don’t forget to brush up on these concepts:  
  
  
Closures: What they are, and how they preserve lexical scope.  
  
Hoisting: How var, let, const, and function declarations behave.  
  
Event Loop: Call stack, microtasks, macrotasks, and how async code is executed.  
  
Promises: How they work and common pitfalls with chaining.  
  
Async/Await: Syntax sugar over promises, error handling, and best practices.  
  
Scope: Difference between global, function, and block scope.  
  
This Keyword: Behavior in different contexts (regular function, arrow function, object methods).  
  
Prototypes & Inheritance: How prototype chaining works.  
  
Call, Apply, Bind: Function borrowing and controlling this.  
  
Currying: Converting a function with multiple arguments into nested unary functions.  
  
Debouncing & Throttling: Optimizing performance in scroll/input events.  
  
Type Coercion: Loose vs strict equality, falsy/truthy values.  
  
Null vs Undefined: Key differences and when each is used.  
  
Event Delegation: How to handle events efficiently.  
  
setTimeout vs setInterval: Execution behavior and clear mechanisms.  
  
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression): Why and when it’s used.  
  
Modules (ES6): Named vs default exports, import/export syntax.  
  
Object Destructuring & Spread/Rest: Clean syntax for copying and unpacking.  
  
Memory Management: Garbage collection basics and memory leaks.  
  
Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing: Clean handling of deeply nested objects.  
  
Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): Why accessing let or const before declaration throws an error.  
  
Pure Functions & Side Effects: Core to functional programming and clean code.  
  
Array Methods — map, filter, reduce, find, some, every: Interviewers love them.  
  
Deep vs Shallow Copy: Using structuredClone, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...)), spread syntax, etc.  
  
Generators & Iterators: Lazy evaluation, yield, and custom iterable protocols.
