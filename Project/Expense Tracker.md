### Frontend
1. Sidebar: each component should have its own file
2.  Make another filed with password view option in profile page for updating the password
3.  Follow ATOMIC Structure
4. Make storybook for components 
5. token can be saved in either local storage or cookies
### Backend
1. Introduce Service layer
2. Swagger for documentation
3. Server file 
	- import file with list of all the routes rather than describing them in one place

1. Add limit to get request and options for 
2.  get request for Searching
3.  make CORS for every specific endpoint (like if)
4.  http header certificate (HSTS) 
5. Try to ensure that client only get minimum data from each request they made to server but also get their request fulfilled 
### Overall
1. No pagination, try to apply 
2. Deploy with production build
3. try to use linting

### Suggestion
1. API---> Serverless ---> Kubernetes ---> Lambda
2. RESTapi is fine
3. Graphql is mostly used with microservices
4. Microservices are the services with each models (like expense and users model) are defined separately
